# Admin System Requirements

## Question 1 []

- Create a super Admin route, when the super admin logs in, then he/she will be redirected to a "/routing-hub".
- **Hint:** On the layout file where the super-admin wishes to navigate allow the doorway to be opened for the role of super-admin as well.

## Question 2 []

- On the `/customer` for the sidebar profile image, when you click the pencil the modal that opens, I want you to add a background image that stands behind the image as in the image I've sent on the group. The customer must be able to upload a background image.

## Question 3 []

- For the `/customer` under the support in the sidebar create a messaging system, where a customer can send a message to admin with a title, their name, email and the actual support message.
- On the admin panel create a route for the admin sidebar that shows all the messages that came from a customer.
